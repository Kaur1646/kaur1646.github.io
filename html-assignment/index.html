<article><h2> About Me</h2></article>
    <br>
    <p>Myself is Jaspreet Kaur. I am  19<sup>th</sup>years old.  I am from India. I completed my senior secondary education last year.
         I came from india to Canada last month. I live alone with my family here. Well, I have a great interest in singing, reading
          books, doing some adventurous activities, and also in driving
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I chose the interactive media design program because it includes lots of subjects, such as digital graphics,
         web development, photography, design foundation and more. I want to make my career in web development because 
         I like coding. Designing a website seems a very interesting and challenging task for me.</p> <br>
